SPECIAL COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS:

1.	Nothing changes when compiling on the MAC.  The instructions
	in the Readme.md file are valid

2.	Nothing really changes when compiling on the WIN11 virtual.
	The instructions in the Readme.md file are valid

3.	HOWEVER.....there is a new bash script (makefish.sh) that 
	was downloaded from:
	https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Building-Stockfish-on-Windows

	(The new bash script file (makefish.sh) is in both the src and src.15 folders)

	This script will do the following:
	1)	Update the Msys2 tools (on Win11) if necessary
	2)	download the latest copy of Stockfish source
		- a new zip file (master.zip) is created in the src directory
	3)	Unzip the master.zip file into a new directory named
		Stockfish.master in the src directory
	4)	The script will then proceed to compile & test the
		resultant executable saving the fastest compiled version
		.exe file in the src directory...not the Stockfish.master dir.

	Bottom Line:  	The only reason to run this bash script would be
			to obtain the latest copy of the Stockfish source
			which I would then need to add all of MY mods to
			it.
